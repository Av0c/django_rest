# CryptoCurrency Portfolio Manager

A Django project implementing the **REST_framework** that allows a group to share and manage their cryptocurrency trading portfolios.

## Getting Started

These instructions will (hopefully) get you up and running the project in no time :)

### Prerequisites

Versions used for project:
- python==3.6.4
- djangorestframework==3.7.7

pip install djangorestframework
```

### Running

Start the local server with the project

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Users

There're currently 3 users:

All users have the same password `password123`

'admin' will have extra privileges.
